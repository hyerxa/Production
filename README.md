# Production
This project is an application for a media player production facility that allows employees to sign in, add products, and create production records. 
This was made by author Haley Yerxa as a class project, with some assistance from Professor Scott Vanselow, student assistants, and classmates.
Created Fall 2020, a semester long project as a 3rd year software engineering student in an Object- Oriented Programming class at Florida Gulf Coast University.
Was made in class as an assignment, but was taken as a challenge to further skills and become more proficient in Java, Databases, and associated OOP skills.
