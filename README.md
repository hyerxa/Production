# Production
This project is an application for a media player production facility that allows employees to sign in, add products, and create production records. 
This was made by author Haley Yerxa as a class project, with some assistance from Professor Scott Vanselow, student assistants, and classmates.
Created Fall 2020, a semester long project as a 3rd year software engineering student in an Object- Oriented Programming class at Florida Gulf Coast University.
Was made in class as an assignment, but was taken as a challenge to further skills and become more proficient in Java, Databases, and associated OOP skills.

## Getting Started
This project is built using Gradle on Intellij Idea, so for optimal performance, I recommend cloning work into Intellij Idea. 
Requires Java, currently configured for SDK 11. Gradle build file is included, so minimum configuration is required. 
Uses JavaFX, for development purposes I recommend downloading and using SceneBuilder.
## Built With
* Intellij Idea Ultimate
* JavaFx and SceneBuilder
* Gradle
* H2 Database

## History
Developed in three sprints:
1. Set up GUI and basic database connection.
2. Add object-oriented concepts and implementation.
3. Complete Database integration and add finishing touches.
