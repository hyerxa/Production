# Production
This project is a software for a media player production facility that keeps track of what products are produced. 
This was made by author Haley Yerxa as a class project, with some assistance from Professor Scott Vanselow, student assistants, and classmates.
Created Fall 2020, a semester long project as a 3rd year software engineering student in Object Oriented Programming class.
Was made in class as an assignment, but was taken as a challenge to further skills and become more proficient in Java and associated OOP skills.
